      <h2> Build webadmin which is a part of nx_vms repository. </h2>

      <p>
        Technically it's linux project. But since it's cross-platform and
        included into any distribution it's built solely.
        And then it's consumed by installers.

      <p>
        This job consumes few groups of parameters.
      <p>
        Parameters related to workspace cleaning logic
        CLEAN_WORKSPACE, CLEAN_CLONE and CLEAN_BUILD.
      <p>
        Parameters related to pointing artifacts in repository and development process
        BUILD_IDENTITY (that determines release id or build_number used for releases) and
        NX_VMS_COMMIT exact commit of sources taht produced this build.
