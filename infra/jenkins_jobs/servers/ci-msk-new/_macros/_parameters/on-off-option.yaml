# This parameter is for switching something. It's wrapper over extended-choice.
# So all options are passed as text in the end.
# This behaviour is better than boolen parameter for some cases:
# - text is not deformed during bypassing from build to build
# - extra information in UI may be added for each option (in future)
# It's also good for enabling/disabling cmake flags
#
# Parameters:
# - name
# - default
