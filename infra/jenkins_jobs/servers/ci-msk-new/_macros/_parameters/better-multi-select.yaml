# This is special parameter that wraps extended-choice with multi-select in
# way which makes it easier and better to configure.
#
# Parameters:
# - name - name of parameter
# - choices - array options struct, ex: [ [a, A], [b, B], [c, D] .. ]
#   where first item of pair will be used as value for variable, and the second
#   one will be used in UI as value description
# - allowed_choices - array which choices to include in parameter UI - this
#   helps to keep all choices defined once and DRY. Instead of rewriting
#   choices, one may just write which options are allowed. If allowed_choices
#   are not declared, then all options are allowed
#   ex: [ a, c ]
# - default - default value which is selected, ex: "a"
# - description - description of parameter visible in UI
