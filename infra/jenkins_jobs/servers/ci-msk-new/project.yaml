    # We use some trick to reuse precompiled obj files.
    # Dirty builds run faster than clean and we are trying to optimize build speed.
    #
    # Given axes:
    #  platform         linux-64, linux-86, windows-86, ..
    #  branch           default, vms, vms_3.2, ..
    #  customization    default, hanwha, ..
    #
    # Optimization rules:
    #  changing platform       -> full rebuild
    #  changing branch         -> full rebuild (looks like)
    #  changing customization  -> partial rebuild
    #
    # The solution is:
    # 1. Keep platform x branch in separate workspaces
    # 2. Allow to build different customization in the same place
    # 3. Mess-up auto, release and custom pipelines into the same workspace (this may result in
    #    full rebuild in future, but anyways we may control build time and see this problem)
    #
    # Job specific:
    # According to prev. facts,
    # - all platform x branch variables are frozen in job
    # - all customization-related stuff is passed as arguments

    # in some cases there is a "cleaner" script that does some actions inbetween dirty builds.
    # this path is optional but if it exists, cleaner will be invoked
